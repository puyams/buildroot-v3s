# buildroot-v3s #

An external layer for buildroot to get Allwinner V3s based systems (like the
LicheePi Zero) up and running.

Based upon the information of the
[buildroot user manual](https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html)
about keeping customizations outside of buildroot.

A script `setup.sh` is added to simplify the usage of the additional layer
by also including the download, unpacking and configuration of a vanilla
buildroot.
